\begin{mysubsection}{}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Arc of a Circle: part of circle
            \begin{enumerate}
                \item Minor arc: the arc with length shorter than half of circumference
                \item Major arc: the arc with length longer than half of circumference
            \end{enumerate}
        \item Chord of a Circle: line segment
            \begin{enumerate}
                \item Chord: line segment joining two points on a circle
                \item Diameter: longest chord in a circle
            \end{enumerate}
        \item Sector of a Circle: region bounded by an arc and two radii
            \begin{enumerate}
                \item Minor sector: the area of it less than half of a circle
                \item Major sector: the area of it more than half of a circle
            \end{enumerate}
        \item Segment of a Circle: region bounded by a chord and an arc
            \begin{enumerate}
                \item Minor segment: the area of it less than half of the circle
                \item Major segment: the area of it more than half of the circle
            \end{enumerate}
        \item Circumcircle of a polygon: a circle pass through all the vertices of the polygon
        \item Inscribed circle of a polygon: a circle enclosed by the polygon such that each side of the polygon touches the circle at only one point
    \end{enumerate}
