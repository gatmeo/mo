\qitem{%
    In triangle $ABC$, vertices $A$ and $C$, the center of the incircle and the center of the circumcircle lie on the same circle. Find $\angle B$.
    }{%
    If $O$ is the circumcenter and $I$ is the incenter
    $\angle AIC=180-\frac{1}{2}(\angle A+\angle C)=90+\frac{1}{2}\angle B$
    $\angle AOC=2\angle B$

    Since $AIOC$ is a cyclic quad, $\angle AIC=\angle AOC$, so $B=\frac{2}{3}(90)=\boxed{60}$
