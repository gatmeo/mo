    How many noncongruent triangles with integer side lengths have have a perimeter of 20 units?
    }{%
    Case 1: 1 length is 5
    The other two sides must add to 15 and satisfy the Triangle Inequality: (6, 9) (7, 8) => 2
    Case 2: 1 length is 6
    (6, 8) (7, 7) => 2
    Case 3: 1 length is 7
    (4, 9) => 1
    Case 4: 1 length is 8
    (3, 9) (4, 8) => 2
    Case 5: 1 length is 9
    (2, 9) => 1
    Nothing above 9 will work, so the answer is, [when adding up all cases], $\boxed{8}$.
