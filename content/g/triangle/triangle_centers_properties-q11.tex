    Let $C$ and $C’$ be two circles with centers at $O$ and $O’$, respectively, intersecting at two different points $P$ and $Q$. Let $\ell$ be a line through $ P$ that intersects $C$ and $C’$ at two points $ B$ and $B’$, respectively. Let $ A$ be the circumcenter of triangle $BB’Q$. Prove that $A$ lies on the circumcircle of passing through $O$, $O’$, and $Q$.

    Let $\angle PBQ=\theta$. Then $\angle POQ=2\theta$ and since $OO'$ bisects $\angle POQ$, $\angle O'OQ=180-\theta$. But since $\angle QBB'=180-\theta$ and $O'A$ bisects $\angle QAB'$, $\angle O'AQ=\theta$ and thus $OO'AQ$ is cyclic.
