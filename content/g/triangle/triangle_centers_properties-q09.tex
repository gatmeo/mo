    $O$ and $I$ are the circumcentre and incentre of $\vartriangle ABC$ respectively. Suppose $O$ lies in the interior of $\vartriangle ABC$ and $I$ lies on the circle passing through $B, O$, and $C$. What is the magnitude of $\angle B AC$ in degrees?
    }{%
    We have $\angle BOC=\angle BIC$(angle subtended by the same segment). Now as $\angle BOC$ is the central angle... This implies that $\angle BOC=2\angle A=\angle BIC$.

We know that as $I$ is the incenter to $\Delta ABC$ we have $\angle BIC=90+(\angle A)/2$.
So $\angle BIC= 90+(\angle A)/2= 2\angle A \implies \angle A=\boxed{60}$
