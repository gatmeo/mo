\qitem{%
    $\triangle ABC$ has medians of length $12$ and $15$. What is the maximum possible area of $\triangle ABC$?
    }{%
    Let $G$ be the centroid of $\triangle ABC$. Notice that the area of $ABDF$ is three-fourths of the area of $ABC$. Let $\angle AGB=\theta$. Then, the area of $ABDF$ is $\tfrac{15 \cdot 12 \cdot \sin \theta}{2}$, so the area is maximized when $\theta=90^\circ$, and the maximum value is $90$. Thus, the maximum area of $\triangle ABC$ is $\boxed{120}$.

    Let $AM=12$ and $BN=15$. Then $AG=8$ and $BG=10$. These are two sides of a triangle $\triangle AGB$. Maximize the area of this triangle.
