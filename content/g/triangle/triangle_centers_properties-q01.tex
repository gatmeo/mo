\qitem{%
    $AB,AC$ are tangents from $A$ to a circle touching the circle at $B,C$. If $D$ is the midpoint of the minor arc $BC$, prove that $D$ is the incentre of $\triangle ABC$
    }{%
    It is obvious that $\overline{AD}$ is the bisector of $\angle BAC$. Joining $\overline{DB}$ and $\overline{CD}$, we can tell that $\angle ABD = \angle ACD = \angle DBC = \angle DCB$. Thus, $\overline{BD}$ and $\overline{CD}$ are bisectors of $\angle ABC$ and $\angle ACB$, with them intersecting at $D$, which is the incenter of $\triangle ABC$.
