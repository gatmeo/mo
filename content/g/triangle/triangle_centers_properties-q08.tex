    In a triangle $ABC$, let $I$ denote the incenter. Let the line segments $AI,BI$ and $CI$ intersect the incircle at $P,Q$ and $R$, respectively. If $\angle BAC = 40^o$, what is the value of $\angle QPR$ in degrees ?
    }{%
    Angle BIC is equal to 90 + 0.5A through some angle chasing. BIC is equal to QIR which is equal to 110, which makes QPR 55 degrees.\\
    or\\
    we know that $AI$ is an angle bisector so it also bisects $\angle{QPR}$, now PQ=PR=QR=inradius, so angle QIR comes as $360^\circ-4\angle{QPI}$ now we know , $QIR=4\angle{QPI}=90+\frac{\angle{BAC}}{2}$, solve, it so we get $2 \angle{QPI}=55^\circ$, or say $\angle{QPR}=55^\circ$
