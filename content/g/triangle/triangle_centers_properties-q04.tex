    Given a right-angled triangle $ABC$ with right angle $C$, $AA_1$ and $BB_1$ , it's angle bisectors. Points $A_2$ and $B_2$ are the feet of the perpendiculars drawn from $A_1$ and $B_1$ on $AB$. Prove that the center of the incircle of triangle $ABC$ coincides with the center of the circumcircle of triangle $A_2B_2C$.
    }{%
    Note that $\angle A_1CA=\angle A_1A_2A=90^0 \implies A_1A_2AC$ is cyclic. $\angle CAA_1=\angle A_1AA_2 \implies CA_1=A_1A_2$
    Also $\angle CA_1A+ \angle CAA_1=90^0 \implies \angle CA_1A+ \angle A_1CA_2=90^0 \implies A_1A \perp CA_2 \implies$ I is on the perpendicular bisector of $CA_2$. Analougsly, $I$ is also o the perpendicular bisector of $CB_2$.
