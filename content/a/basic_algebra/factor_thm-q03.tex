    Find the remainder when $x^{100}$ is divided by $(x - 1)(x - 2)$.
    }{%
    Since $(x - 1)(x - 2)$ has degree 2, the remainder is of the form $ax + b$ for some constants $a$ and $b$. Let $q(x)$ be the quotient, so \[ x^{100} = (x - 1)(x - 2) q(x) + ax + b. \]

    Letting $x = 1$ and $x = 2$, respectively, we obtain the equations $1 = a + b$ and $2^{100} = 2a + b$. Solving this system, we find $a = 2^{100} - 1$ and $b = 2 - 2^{100}$. Therefore, the remainder is $\boxed{(2^{100} - 1)x - 2^{100} + 2}$.
