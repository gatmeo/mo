\qitem{%
    What is the sum of all integers $n$ such that $n^2+2n+2$ divides $n^3+4x^2+4x-14$.
    }{%
    $n^3+4n^2+4n-14=(n^2+2n+2)(n+2)+(-2n-18)$

    We need $(n^2+2n+2)|(-2n-18)$. So we have either $-2n-18=0$, or $\left|-2n-18\right|\geq \left|n^2+2n+2\right|$. The first case is $n=-9$, the later we have $-4\leq n\leq 4$, Check every possible answers we have $n=-4,-2,-1,0,1,4$.

    Hence the sum is $-11$.
