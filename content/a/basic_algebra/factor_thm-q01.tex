\qitem{%
    It is given that $2x^3+px^2-25x+q$ is divisible by $2x^2+7x-4$. Find the values of $p$ and $q$, and hence the quotient of $(2x^3+px^2-25x+q)/(2x^2+7x-4)$ 
    }{%
    $2x^2+7x-4=(2x-1)(x+4)$. Sub $x=\frac{1}{2}, -4$, we have $p=1, q=12$. By long division we have $x-3$ as quotient. or, we can find $q/-4$ and $2/2$ as the last factor.
