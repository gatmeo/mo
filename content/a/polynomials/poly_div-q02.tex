    The remainder when $f(x)=x^5-2x^4+ax^3-x^2+bx-2$ is divided by $x+1$ is $-7$. When $f(x)$ is divided by $x-2$ the remainder is $32$. Determine the remainder when $f(x)$ is divided by $x-1$.

    So from the first statement, we have $f(-1)=-7 \rightarrow a+b=1$

    From the second, we have $f(2)=32 \rightarrow 4a+b=19$. Solving the system we have $a=6, b=-5$.

    We want to find $f(1)=a+b-4=\boxed{-3}$
