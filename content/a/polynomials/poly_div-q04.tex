    The polynomial
    $$g(x) = x^3 - x^2 - (m^2 + m) x + 2m^2 + 4m + 2$$is divisible by $x-4$ and all of its zeroes are integers. Find all possible values of $m$.
    }{%
    If $x-4|g(x)$ then we know that $g(4)=0$. So $g(4)=50-2m^2=0$ which gives us that $m=5,-5$.

    Well, $m=-5$ fails since $g(x)=x^3-x^2-20x+32=(x-4)(x^2+3x-8)$.
    $m=5$ does work since $g(x)=x^3-x^2-30x+72=(x-3)(x-4)(x+6)$. So the answer is $m=5$.
