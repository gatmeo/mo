\qitem{%
    Factor $x^{12}+x^6+1$ as completely as possible, into a product of linear and irreducible quadratic factors. (quadratic with no real roots)
    }{%
    We can rewrite $x^{12} + x^{6} + 1$ as $\frac{x^{18}-1}{x^{6}-1}$. We can then factor the denominator and numerator of each of these terms: $\frac{(x^{3}+1)(x^{6} - x^{3} + 1 )(x^{3}-1) (x^{6} + x^{3} + 1)} {(x^{3}+1)(x^{3} - 1)}$. Our final answer is $(x^{6} - x^{3} + 1)(x^{6} + x^{3} + 1)$.
