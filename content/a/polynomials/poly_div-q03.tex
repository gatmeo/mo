    Let $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ be polynomials with real coefficients. The polynomial $f(x)$ has remainder $x+1$ when divided by $x^2+1$; the polynomial $g(x)$ has remainder $x-1$ when divided by $x^2+1$.

    What is the remainder of $f(x)\cdot g(x)$ when divided by $x^2+1$?
    }{%
    Let $f(x)=a(x)*(x^2+1)+x+1$, and let $g(x)=b(x)*(x^2+1)+x-1$. Then $$f(x)*g(x)=(a(x)*b(x)*(x^2+1)+(x-1)*a(x)+(x+1)*b(x))*(x^2+1)+(x^2-1)=(junk)*(x^2+1)-2$$Thus the remainder is $\boxed{-2}$
