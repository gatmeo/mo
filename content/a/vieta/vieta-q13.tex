Find the value of $a$ such that the roots $\alpha$ and $\beta$ of the quadratic equation $x^2 + ax + a + 1 = 0$ are real and satisfy the relation $\alpha^3 + \beta^3 = 9.$

    I used Vieta's relations to make a system of equations and then solved it. I ended up with the equation $(-a^2 + 3)(a-3)=0$ and therefore found:
$a = 3$ or $a = \sqrt{3}$ or $a = -\sqrt{3}.$
