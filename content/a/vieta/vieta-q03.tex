    Let $a$ and $b$ be the roots of $x^2-3x-1=0$. Find a quadratic equation whose roots are $a^2$ and $b^2$. And compute $\frac{1}{a+1}+\frac{1}{b+1}$. (Hint: find a quadratic equation whose roots are $\frac{1}{a+1}$ and $\frac{1}{b+1}$).
    }{%
    We have $a^2b^2=(ab)^2=(-1)^2=1$, $a^2+b^2=(a+b)^2-2ab=3^2-2(-1)=11$. Hence $x^2-11x+1=0$ is the required equation.

    The eqation $(x-1)^2-3(x-1)-1=0$, or $x^2-5x+3=0$ has roots $a+1$ and $b+1$. Similarly $(\frac{1}{x}^2-5(\frac{1}{x})+3=0$, or $1-5x+3x^2=0$ has roots $\frac{1}{a+1}$ and $\frac{1}{b+1}$. Hence $\frac{1}{a+1}+\frac{1}{b+1}=\frac{5}{3}$.
