\qitem{%
    If a and b are the two roots of $x^2+x-5$, find $a^3-6b^2$.
    }{%
    We have $a^3+a^2-5a=0\implies a^3=-a^2+5a$
    and also, $a^2+a-5=0\implies a^2=-a+5$
    which gives us $a^3=6a-5$

    Also, we have: $b^2+b-5\implies b^2=-b+5$

    Hence, we only need to find the value of:
    $$a^3-6b^2=(6a-5)-6(-b+5)=6(a+b)-35$$And, by Vieta's formula, we know that $a+b=-1$. Hence, the answer is:
    $$6(a+b)-35=6(-1)-35=\boxed{-41}$$
