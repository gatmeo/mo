    Find the sum of all the roots of the equation $x^{2001}+(\frac{1}{2}-x)^{2001}=0$.
    }{%
    Using Vieta's formulas is left as an exercise. A shortcut solution is to observe that if $x$ is a root, so is $\frac{1}{2} -x$, and each such pair yields a total of $\frac{1}{2}$. There are $2000$ roots, so the total is $500$.
