\qitem{%
    Prove that for any positive integer $n,$ there exists an $m$ where $m$ is a multiple of $n+1$ and $|n^n-m|=1.$
    }{%
    Note that $n \equiv -1 \pmod{n+1}$ since $n = (n+1) - 1,$ so $n^n \equiv (-1)^n \pmod{n+1}.$ Thus if $n$ is odd, then $m=n^n+1$ and if $n$ is even, then $m=n^n-1.$
