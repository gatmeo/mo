    Zan has created this iterative rule for generating sequences of whole numbers:
    * If a number is $25$ or less, double the number.
    * If a number is greater than $25$, subtract $12$ from it.

    Let $F$ be the first number in a sequence generated by te rule above. $F$ is a sweet number if $16$ is not a term in the sequence that starts with $F$. How many of the whole numbers $1$ through $50$ are sweet numbers?
    }{%
    Note that doubling a number or adding subtracting $12$ will not change the number $\pmod 3$ if it is $0 \pmod 3$. If it is $1 \pmod 3$ or $2 \pmod 3$, then double it will change between each of them. This means that if a number is $0 \pmod 3$, it is impossible for it to reach $16$, which is $1 \pmod 3$. For every other number, it will eventually cycle through all the numbers from $0$ through $25$ that are $1 \pmod 3$ or $2 \pmod 3$, I'm pretty sure.

    First note that every number will eventually land between 14-50, and once it does, there is no way for a number to go above 50 or below 14 ever again. Also note that every number will eventually land on a multiple of 4, and once it does, it will stay that way. If a number is on a multiple on 3, there is no way for it to stop being a multiple of 3; if a term in a sequence is a multiple of 3, so is every subsequent term. However, if a term is not a multiple of 3, there is no way for subsequent terms to be multiples of 3. this means every sequence either contains only multiples of 3, or no multiples of 3. However, every sequence will eventually lead to only having multiples of 4. This means that if a sequence is a multiple of 3, it will eventually land on multiples of 12, and form the loop 24-48-36-24-48-36.... But if a sequence is not a multiple of 3, it will eventually lead into a loop containing some or all of these terms: 16, 20, 28, 32, 40, 44. Let's see if we can create a loop. Starting with 16, we get 16-32-20-40-28-16-32-20-40-28.... This uses every number except for 44. However, 44 just goes directly to 32. Every number that isn't divisible by 3 eventually leads to one of these 6 numbers, ending with a loop, while numbers that are multiples of 3 lead to a different loop, and are therefore all sweet.
