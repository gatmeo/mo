    How do I solve problems like these only using divisibility (without congruence)
    Explain the approach

    1)Prove that the number $100...00500...001$(100 zeroes in each group) is not a perfect cube

    2)prove that $a^3+b^3+4$ is not a perfect cube for any natural number $a$ and $b$

    3)Prove that the number $6n^3 + 3$ cannot be a perfect sixth power of
    an integer for any natural number $n$.

    $(1) \ \ \ mod \ 9$

    $(2) \ \ \ mod \ 9$

    $(3) \ \ \ mod \ 7$

    $ps: \ x^3 \equiv 0,\pm1\ \ \ (mod \ \ 9) \\ \qquad x^3 \equiv 0,\pm1\ \ \ (mod \ \ 7) \\ \qquad x^6 \equiv 0,1\ \ \ (mod \ \ 7)$
