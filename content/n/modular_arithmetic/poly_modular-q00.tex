    For positive integer $n$, prove that $n^6+2n^5-n^2-2n \equiv 0 \pmod {120}$. In other words, prove that $n^6+2n^5-n^2-2n$ is divisible by $120$.
    }{%
    Note that $n^6+2n^5-n^2-2n=n(n+2)(n^4-1)=(n-1)n(n+1)(n+2)(n^2+1)$. The first four terms are four consecutive integers, so one of them is divisible by $3$ and one of them is divisible by $4$. In addition, at least two of those terms must be even, so another term is divisible by $2$, so $(n-1)n(n+1)(n+2)$ is divisible by $24$.
    Assume that the product is not divisible by $5$. Then, $n$ cannot be equivalent to $1$, $0$, $4$, or $3\pmod{5}$, as that would mean one of the first four terms is divisible by $5$. Then, $n\equiv 2\pmod{5}$, but then $5|n^2+1$, a contradiction. Thus, the product must be divisible by $5$, and thus divisible by $24 \cdot 5 = 120$.
