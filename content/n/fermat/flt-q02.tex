    What are the possible periods of the sequence $x,x^2,x^3,\dots$ in mod $13$ for different values of $x$? Find values of $x$ that achieve these periods.
    }{%
    Since $x^{12}\equiv 1$, we have every cyclic length to be factor of $12$. Since $x=1$ has cycle length $1$, $x=2$ has cycle length $12$, and hence we have $2^2$ of cycle $6$, $2^3$ of cycle $12/3$, $2^4$ of cycle $3$, $2^6$ of cycle 2.
