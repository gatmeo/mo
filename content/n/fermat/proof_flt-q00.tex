\qitem{%
    Find all positive integers $x$ such that $2^{2^x+1}+2$ is divisible by $17$.
    }{%
    Since we have $2^{16}\equiv 1(17)$, for $x\geq 4$, we have $2^{2^{x}+1}=2^{16(k)+1}\equiv 2(17)$, $2^{2^{x}+1}+2\equiv 4\neq 0(17)$. No $x$ satisfy. We just have to check $x\leq 3$, and get when $x=2$, it is true.
