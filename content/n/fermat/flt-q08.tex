Solve the following equation in the set of integers
$x^5 + 2 = 3 \cdot 101^y$.
    }{%
    If $y$ is negative, $LHS$ is an integers whereas $RHS$ isn't, which is impossible. If $y = 0$, we get $x = 1$. 
    If $y>0$ then $x^5\equiv -2\text{(mod 101)}\implies x^{100}\equiv 95\text{(mod 101)}$, a contradiction. Thus the only solution is $\boxed{(x,y)=(1,0)}$
