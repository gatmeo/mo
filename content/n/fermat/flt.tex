    Solve the congruence $x^{103}\equiv 4$ mod $11$.
    }{%
    $x^{10}\equiv 1(11)$, we can just solve $x^{103}\equiv x^3(11)$. We try from $x=1$ to $10$, we have $x\equiv 5(11)$.

\qitem{%
    Find all integers $x$ such that $x^{86}\equiv 6$ mod $29$.
    }{%
    We just have to solve $x^{86}\equiv x^2\equiv 6 (29)$. which is the same as $x^2\equiv 64(29)$, hence we have $(x+8)(x-8)\equiv 0(29)$.

    What are the possible periods of the sequence $x,x^2,x^3,\dots$ in mod $13$ for different values of $x$? Find values of $x$ that achieve these periods.
    }{%
    Since $x^{12}\equiv 1$, we have every cyclic length to be factor of $12$. Since $x=1$ has cycle length $1$, $x=2$ has cycle length $12$, and hence we have $2^2$ of cycle $6$, $2^3$ of cycle $12/3$, $2^4$ of cycle $3$, $2^6$ of cycle 2.

    Let $p\not|10$ be a prime. Prove that $p$ divides infinitely many numbers of the form $11\dots11$.
    }{%
    We have $11\dots 1\equiv (10^n-1)/9$, and since $10^{(p-1)k}\equiv 1 (p)$, $10^{(p-1)k}-1\equiv 0(p)$.

    Find all primes $p$ such that $p|2^p+1$.

    $2^{p}+1=2^{p-1+1}+1\equiv 2^{p-1}\cdot 2+1\equiv 2+1\equiv 3(p)$, hence $p\mid 3$.

    What day of the week will it be a googolplex days from now? (A googolplex is $10^{10^{100}}$; Today is Sunday)
    }{%
    Since $10^{6}\equiv 1(7)$, we wanna find $10^{100}$ mod $6$. Since $10^2\equiv 100\equiv 4\equiv 10 (6)$, hence $10^{100}\equiv 4(6)$, $10^{100}=6k+4$ for some $k$, hence 
    \[10^{10^{100}}=10^{6k+4}=(10 ^6)^{k}10^{4}\equiv 1^{k}100^2\equiv 100^2\equiv 2^2\equiv 4 (7).\]

    Let $a_1=4$, $a_n=4^{a_{n-1}}$, $n>1$. Find the remainder when $a_{100}$ is divisided by 7.
    }{%
    Since $4^6\equiv 1(7)$. Since we can check that $4^{a}\equiv 4(6)$ for all positive $a$. Thus $4^{a_k}\equiv 4(6)$ for all positive $k$, which means $a_{k+1}\equiv 4(6)$ for all $k$. We have $a_{99}=4+6t$ for some $t$, hence
    \[a_{100}\equiv 4^{a_{99}}\equiv 4^{4+6t}\equiv 4^4\equiv 4 (7)\]

\qitem{%
    Find all positive integers $x$ such that $2^{2^x+1}+2$ is divisible by $17$.
    }{%
    Since we have $2^{16}\equiv 1(17)$, for $x\geq 4$, we have $2^{2^{x}+1}=2^{16(k)+1}\equiv 2(17)$, $2^{2^{x}+1}+2\equiv 4\neq 0(17)$. No $x$ satisfy. We just have to check $x\leq 3$, and get when $x=2$, it is true.
