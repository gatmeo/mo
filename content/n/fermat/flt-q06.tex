    Let $a_1=4$, $a_n=4^{a_{n-1}}$, $n>1$. Find the remainder when $a_{100}$ is divisided by 7.
    }{%
    Since $4^6\equiv 1(7)$. Since we can check that $4^{a}\equiv 4(6)$ for all positive $a$. Thus $4^{a_k}\equiv 4(6)$ for all positive $k$, which means $a_{k+1}\equiv 4(6)$ for all $k$. We have $a_{99}=4+6t$ for some $t$, hence
    \[a_{100}\equiv 4^{a_{99}}\equiv 4^{4+6t}\equiv 4^4\equiv 4 (7)\]
