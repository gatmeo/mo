\qitem{%
    Find all prime number $p$ and positive number $n$ such that $p-1\mid n+3$ and $p\mid 2^{n-1}+3$.
    }{%
    We have the pair $(p,n)=(2,1)$. Now suppose $p$ is odd. We know $n-1\equiv -4 \pmod {p-1}$ $$\implies \exists k: n-1=-4+k(p-1)$$$$\implies 2^{n-1}=2^{k(p-1)-4}\equiv -3 \pmod p$$Now, by Fermat's little theorem, we have that $$ -3\equiv 2^{k(p-1)-4}\equiv 2^{-4} \pmod p \implies p\mid 49$$Therefore, $(7,6k+3)$ and $(2,1)$ are the only solutions.
