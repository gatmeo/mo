    Find the set of all positive integers $n$ with the property that the set
    \begin{alignat*}{1}
        \left\{n,n+1,n+2,n+3,n+4,n+5\right\}
    \end{alignat*}
    can be partitioned into 2 sets such that the product of the numbers in one set equals the product of the numbers in the other set.

    Consider mod $7$, if only one element is divisible by $7$, then the product of two sets is not equal. 

    If all relatively prime to $7$, we know 
    \[n(n+1)\cdots (n+6)\equiv 1\cdot 2\cdot \cdots \cdot 6\equiv A\cdot B\equiv -1 (7)\]
    If $A=B$, we have $A^2\equiv -1 (7)$, which is impossible by checking.
