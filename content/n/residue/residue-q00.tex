Question: For how many $n$ between 1 and 2520 do we have $n^3\equiv 1$ (mod 2520)?
    }{%
    Let $f(a)$ be the number of solutions to the congruence $n^3\equiv 1$(mod a). By the Chinese Remainder Theorem, f is a multiplicative function. Thus, since $2520 = 8*9*5*7$, $f(2520) = f(8)*f(9)*f(5)*f(7)$. Since f$(8) = f(5) = 1$ and $f(9) = f(7) = 3$, we have $f(2520) = 1*3*1*3 = 9$.
