    Suppose that $N$ can be written in base $6$ as $531340_6$ and in base $8$ as $124154_8$. In base $10$, what is the remainder when $N$ is divided by $210$?
    }{%
    We look at the $0$ at the end of the first number base $6$, which means that $n \equiv 0 \pmod{6}$. Now, we need to find $n \pmod{7}$ and $n \equiv 5 \pmod{7}$. $6 \equiv 1 \pmod{5}$, so
$$n \equiv 5+3+1+3+4+0 \equiv 1 \pmod{5}.$$Also, $6 \equiv -1 \pmod{7}$, so
$$n \equiv -5+3-1+3-4+0 \equiv 3 \pmod{7}.$$Let $n = 6k$. Then $6k \equiv k \equiv 1 \pmod{5}$, so $k = 5a+1$ and $n = 6(5a+1) = 30a + 6$.
$$30a + 6 \equiv 3 \pmod{7} \Rightarrow 2a \equiv 4 \pmod{7} \Rightarrow a \equiv 2 \pmod{7}.$$$a = 7b+2$, so $n = 30(7b+2) + 6 = 210b + 66$, so the remainder is $\boxed{66}$.
