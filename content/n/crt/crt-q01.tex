    What is the highest common divisor of all expressions of the form

    for all $n\geq 1$?

    The answer is $24$.

    To see why the answer must be a divisor of $24$, take $n=1$.

    To prove that the answer must be a multiple of $24$, we use CRT.

    To take care of the factor of $8$, we know that $25^n + 2* 19^n - 3*13^n \equiv 1 + 2*3^n - 3*5^n \pmod{8}$; since $3$ and $5$ both have order $2$ modulo 8, it suffices to check this relation for $n=0$ and $n=1$, where it obviously holds in both cases.

    To take care of the factor of $3$, we know that $25^n + 2* 19^n - 3*13^n \equiv 1 + 2*1^n - 3*1^n \equiv 0 \pmod{3}$ as an identity.
