\qitem{%
    Suppose $T=1+2+3+\cdots+2018+2019$. Including the sum, how many sums of two or more consecutive positive integers have value $T$?
    }{%
    For the odd number of consecutive integers, it's just the number of odd factors of $2019 \cdot 1010$. So \# of odd factors are
$4+6+4+1=15$ (took out all the odd factors $2 \cdot 3 \cdot 5 \cdot 101 \cdot 673$: $\binom{4}{1}+\binom{4}{2}+\binom{4}{3}+\binom{4}{4}$.). There can't be an even number of consecutive integers ($T$ is an even number), so the ans is $\boxed{15}$.
