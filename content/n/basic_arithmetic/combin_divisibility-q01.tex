    Find the number of 3-digit positive integer ($\overline{xyz}$) such that the sum of it and its reverse order is a multiple of $30$.
    }{%
    $30|101(x+z)+20y$.

    Since $10|20y, 10|101(x+z)$, we then have $10=x+z$.

    Since $1010\equiv 2(3)$, we have $20y\equiv 1$ mod 3, $y\equiv 2\textnormal{mod }3$.

    Hence we have ans $=9\cdot 3$.
