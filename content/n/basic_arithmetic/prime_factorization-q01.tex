You are given the number $1000027$, and you have to find the three digit prime factor(without a calculator).
    }{%
    Well note that 1000027 is quite close to 1000000, only off by 27. You should recognize 27 s a cube, and after realizing that note 1000000 is also a cube. Thus, this is equal to $100^3+3^3$. From here, this should remind you of the sum of cubes formula, $a^3+b^3=(a+b)(a^2-ab+b^2)$. Replacing a and b with 100 and 3, we have $1000027=103\cdot9709$. We can easily check $\fbox{103}$ is prime, so we are done.
