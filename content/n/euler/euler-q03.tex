\qitem{%
    Let $n$ be a positive number. Prove that $n^{20}$ ends with 00, 01, 25 or 76.
    }{%
    Modulo 4, $n^{20} \equiv 0, 1 \pmod{4}$.
    Modulo 25, $n^{20} \equiv 0,1 \pmod{25}$ (if $n$ is divisible by 5, then $n^{20} \equiv 0$; otherwise, by Euler's totient theorem, $n^{20} \equiv 1$).

    Use CRT on the four possible choices of residues to get the result.
