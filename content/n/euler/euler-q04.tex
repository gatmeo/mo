\qitem{%
    Integer numbers $a, b, c, d, e, f$ are such that $a^{12} + b^{12} + c^{12} + d^{12} + e^{12} + f^{12}$ is divisible by $13$. Prove that $abcdef$ is divisible by $13^6$.
    }{%
    Since $a^{12}$ can only take on 2 possible values in mod 13. Either 1 if $gcd(a,13)=1$ or 0 if $13|a$. The only way to get $a^{12}+b^{12}+...\equiv 0\mod 13$, is if $a\equiv b\equiv \cdots \equiv f\equiv 0\mod 13$.
