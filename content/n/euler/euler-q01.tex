\qitem{%
    Find the product of the tens and units digit of $(2^1)(2^2)(2^3)(2^4)...(2^{99})(2^{100})$.
    }{%
    Clearly, the product is equal to $2^{1+2+3+\dots + 100} = 2^{5050}$.

Now, all we have to do is find the expression modulo 100. Euler's Theorem won't work at first, because $\gcd (2,100) \neq 1$. However, we can just consider it modulo 4 and modulo 25, and combine these results to get the expression modulo 100.

Obviously, $4|2^{5050}$, so the expression is $0 \pmod 4$.

We then use Euler's Theorem to find that
$$2^{5050} \equiv (2^{20})^{2520} \cdot 2^{10} \equiv 1^{2520} \cdot 2^{10} \equiv 1024 \equiv 24 \pmod {25}$$Thus, $2^{5050} \equiv 24 \pmod {100}$ (Do you see why?), and our answer is $2 \cdot 4 = \boxed{8}$.
