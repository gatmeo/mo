        Treating each of the balls in the figure below as distinct, how many ways are there to select 3 balls from the same horizontal row?
    }{%
    The smallest row has 3 balls and the largest row has 9 balls. The number of ways to select 3 balls from the same row can be expressed as a sum of binomial coefficients. This can then be computed with the hockey stick identity:
    \[\sum\limits_{k=3}^{9}\binom{k}{3} = \binom{10}{4} = 210.\]
    So, there are 210 ways to select 3 balls from the same row.
