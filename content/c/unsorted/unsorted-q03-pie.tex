\qitem{%
    How many five digit numbers meet the following conditions :

    $\rightarrow$ The numbers are divisible by 5

    $\rightarrow$ The first and last digit of the number are same

    $\rightarrow$ The sum of the digits of the number is divisible by $5$
    }{%
    First and last digits must be $5$ (If last digit is 5, then it would not fit the condition)

    Hence, our number is:

    $5\underline{abc}5.$

    Then, we know that $5 + a + b + c + 5 \equiv 10 + a + b + c \equiv 0 \pmod{5} \implies a + b + c \equiv 0 \pmod{5}.$

    We have $10$ choices for $a$ and $b$. Then, we have $2$ choices for $c$ which will make it satisfy the condition. Hence, we get $10 \cdot 10 \cdot 2 = 200.$
