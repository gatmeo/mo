    In the city of Euclid, there are exactly $999$ houses. For every pair of two houses, a one-way road is built going from one of the two houses to the other (that is, the direction of the road matters). Let $N$ be the number of possible ways to build the roads. Find the last three digits of $N.$
    }{%
    There are $\binom{999}{2}=999\cdot 499$ roads in total and $2$ choices for the direction of each road, whence $2^{999\cdot 499}$ ways to build the roads. Taking $\mod 1000$, we need to find the integer $0\leq r<1000$ satisfying $2^{999\cdot 499}=1000k+r$ for some integer $k$. As $8|2^{999\cdot 499}, 1000$, it follows that $8|r$, whence $r=8r'$ for some integer $0\leq r'<125$. Then $2^{999\cdot 499-3}=125k+r'$, so we need to take $2^{999\cdot 499-3}\mod 125$ and multiply the remainder by $8$. By Euler, $2^{\phi(125)}\equiv 2^{100}\equiv 1\mod 125$. Since $999\cdot 499-3\equiv (-1)\cdot (-1)-3\equiv -2\mod 100$, it follows that $2^{999\cdot 499-3}\equiv 2^{-2}\mod 125$, or the inverse of $4\mod 125$, which is $94$. It follows that $r'=94\implies 8r=\boxed{752}$
