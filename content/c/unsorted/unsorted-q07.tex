    If I roll a 4 sided die, a 6 sided die, and an 8 sided die, (and each die lists on its faces the sequence of natural numbers from 1 to the number of sides of the die), what's the probability that the numbers showing on the bottom sides of the three die show three distinct consecutive numbers?

    Use casework:
    123 - 6 working cases
    234 - 6 working cases
    345 - 4 working cases
    456 - 2 working cases

    Makes a total of $18$ working cases, out of $4\cdot6\cdot8$ total cases, for a probability of $\frac{18}{4\cdot6\cdot8}=\boxed{\frac{3}{32}}$
