    Mui reaches into a jar with coins and selects 5 coins.. There are a total of 20 coins, 10 of which are nickels, 5 are dimes, and 5 are quarters. What is the probailiity that Mui pulls 3 nickels, 1 dime, and 1 quarter. Express your answer as a common fraction.
    }{%
    The total number of combinations is $\binom{20}{5}$, which is 15504.
    Number of combinations for nickels: $\binom{10}{3}$ = 120
    Number of combinations for dimes: 5
    Number of combinations for quarters: 5
    multiplying gets $120*5*5=3000$

    Final answer: $\dfrac{125}{646}$
