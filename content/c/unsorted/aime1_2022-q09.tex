Ellina has twelve blocks, two each of red $\left({\bf R}\right),$ blue $\left({\bf B}\right),$ yellow $\left({\bf Y}\right),$ green $\left({\bf G}\right),$ orange $\left({\bf O}\right),$ and purple $\left({\bf P}\right).$ Call an arrangement of blocks even if there is an even number of blocks between each pair of blocks of the same color. For example, the arrangement
$$ {\text {\bf R B B Y G G Y R O P P O}}$$is even. Ellina arranges her blocks in a row in random order. The probability that her arrangement is even is $\frac mn$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.
    }{%
    Note that one block of each of the colors must go in an odd numbered spot, and one must go in an even numbered spot, to ensure each pair has an even number of blocks between them. Thus, we have $6$ different colored balls to put in the $6$ odd spots (i.e. 1st, 3rd, 5th, etc.), so there are $6!$ ways. Similarly there are $6!$ ways to put the blocks in the even spots. The total number of ways to arrange the blocks is $\frac{12!}{2^6}$, so a computation gives us an answer of $\frac{16}{231}$, so $p+q=\boxed{247}$.
