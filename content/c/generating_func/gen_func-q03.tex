    Find $\binom{n}{2}+\binom{n}{5}+\binom{n}{8}+\cdots$.

    Note that if the coefficient of $x^2$ in $(\frac{1}{3})(f(1)+f(\zeta)+f(\zeta^2))$ is $\binom{n}{2}(1+\zeta^2+\zeta^4).$ The $1$ represents $f(1)$, the $\zeta^2$ represents the $f(\zeta)$, and the $\zeta^4$ represents $f(\zeta^2)$. We want to get all of these to equal $1$. By multiplying the $\zeta^2$ by $\zeta$, and the $\zeta^4$ by $\zeta^2$, we get the desired $1$'s. Therefore, to get the value of the expression, we find the value of $(\frac{1}{3})(f(1)+\zeta f(z)+\zeta^2 f(\zeta^2))$.
