\qitem{%
    John needs to pay 2010 dollars for his dinner. He has an unlimited supply of 2, 5, and 10 dollar notes. In how many ways can he pay?
    }{%
    $\frac{1}{(1-x^2)(1-x^5)(1-x^{10})}=\frac{(1+x^5)(1+x^2+x^4+x^6+x^8)}{(1-x^{10})^3} =(1+x^5)(1+x^2+x^4+x^6+x^8)\sum_{n=0}^\infty \binom{n+2}{2} x^{10n}$

$10n=2010\Rightarrow n=201$

The required number is $\binom{201+2}{2}=\binom{203}{2}$
