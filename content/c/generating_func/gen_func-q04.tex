    Find $\binom{n}{2}+\binom{n}{6}+\cdots$ where each bottom part of each combination of is $2\pmod{4}$.
    }{%
    Note that the coefficient of $x^2$ in $(\frac{1}{4})(f(1)+f(\zeta)+f(\zeta^2)+f(\zeta^3))$, where $\zeta$ is a primitive fourth root of unity, is $\binom{n}{2}(1+\zeta^2+\zeta^4+\zeta^6+\zeta^8). $We want to make all of these become $1$, so following similar steps to what we did above, we get that the desired expression is $(\frac{1}{4})(f(1)+\zeta^2 f(\zeta)+ f(\zeta^2)+ \zeta^2 f(\zeta^3))$.
