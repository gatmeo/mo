    Let $n$ be the number of ways in which 7 men and 5 women can stand in a queue such that all the women stand consecutively. Let $m$ be the number of ways in which the same $12$ persons can stand in a queue such that exactly $6$ men stand consecutively.

    $n$: Consider $6$ women stand as one block: $n=6!\cdot 7!$.

    $m$: Consider the $6$ man in a line as one block, the another man as another block.

    $C^6_2$ ways to arrange men and women.

    $5!$ ways to arrange the women, and $7!$ ways to arrange the men. Thus, $\frac{m}{n}=\frac{30\cdot 120 \cdot 5040}{6\cdot 120 \cdot 5040} = 5$.
