\qitem{%
    At an amusement park, you pay for attractions using tokens. Thereare five different attractions which cost 3 tokens each, and one attraction which cost 5 tokens.  You have 42 tokens and you want to use all of them.  How many different selections of attractions are there?
    }{%
    The questions is equivalent to solving $3x_1+3x_2+3x_3+3x_4+3x_5+5y=42$. Since we need to use all tokens, the number of times we can spend on the attraction that cost 5 tokens are $0,3,6$.

    So we are left to solve $3(x_1+x_2+x_3+x_4+x_5)=12\textnormal{ or }27\textnormal{ or }42$.

    The final answer:
    \[{4+5-1\choose 5-1}+{9+5-1\choose 5-1}+{14+5-1\choose 5-1}=3845\]
