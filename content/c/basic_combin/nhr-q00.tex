\qitem{%
    You are going to an amusement park.  There are four attractions, (haunted house, roller coaster, a carousel, water ride). You buy 25 tokens.  Each attraction cost 3 tokens each ride, except the roller coaster that costs 5. Obviously, you want to ride each ride at least once, but the order of the rides does not matter.

    In how many ways can you spend your tokens?  You may have some remaining tokens in the end of the day.
    }{%
    After riding each once, we have 11 tokens left. We can choose to go for rollar coaster 0,1, of 2 times.

    For 0 times, we have it equal to solving $3a+3b+3c\leq 11$, which equals $3(a+b+c)\leq 9$, $(a+b+c+d)=3$. Hence it is $C_{3}^{3+4-1} $.

    For 1 times, we have it equal to solving $3a+3b+3c\leq 6$, which equals $3(a+b+c)\leq 6$, $(a+b+c+d)=2$. Hence it is $C_{2}^{2+4-1} $.

    For 2 times, there is just one tocken left. So there is one solution

    Ans$=20+10+1=31$.
