\mysection{Arranging Repeating Elements (nHr)}

\begin{mysubsection}{}
    If we are asked how many string with length $5$ consisting of only A, B or C, the answer is simply $3^5$ as order does matter, as each choice for each position is independent of one another. However, if we want to find the number of ways to pick 5 elements out of A, B or C, with repetition, the choices are no longer independent. The way we can view this problem is to change this question to putting 5 elements into 3 boxes, namely box A, box B and box C. The number of balls within the boxes $i$ refers the the number of $i$ that are selected out of the $5$ elements. And we write this as $H_5^3$, where $5$ represents the number of elemets to be chosen, and $3$ represents the number of different elemnts. Hence we have
    \[H_r^n=C_{r}^{n+r-1} =C_{n-1}^{n+r-1} .\]
    And the value of $H_r^n$ equals the number of nonnegative integer solutions of the equation
    \[x_1+x_2+\cdots +x_n=r.\]
