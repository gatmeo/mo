    Find the number of non-decreasing sequence with 7 terms, where the first term equals 1, seventh term equals 11, and the forth term is less than or equal to 6.
    }{%
    Sol1: consider seperately the 4th term equal 1,2,3,4,5,6.

    Sol2: number of sequence with 4th term equal 1 = equal 11, that of 2 = that of 10 ...

    Hence number of sequence with 4th term \textbf{less than} 6:

    $\frac{1}{2}$(All - 4th term = 6)

    4th term = 6: $(C_{1}^{1+5})^2 $.
