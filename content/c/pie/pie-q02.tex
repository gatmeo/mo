\qitem{%
    How many 4-digit positive integers are there for which there are no repeated digits, or for which there may be repeated digits, but all digits are odd?
    }{%
    No repeated digits: $9\cdot 9\cdot 8\cdot 7=4356$

    Repeated odd digits: $5^4=625$

    Both: $5\cdot 4\cdot 3\cdot 2=120$

    Ans$=4235+625-120=5041$.
