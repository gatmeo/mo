    $20$ straight trominoes are placed end to end to form a row of $60$ unit squares. One square within each tromino is randomly chosen to be colored black (so there are $20$ black squares). The other two are colored white. Let $N$ be the number of unordered pairs of adjacent squares with opposing colors. The probability $N$ is odd is $\frac{a}{b}$ for coprime positive integers $a,b.$ Find $a+b.$
    }{%
    Each unordered pair of adjacent squares can be seen as a 'color change'. Black changes to white, and white changes to black. As such, $N$ is odd iff the leftmost square's color differs from the rightmost square's color, occurring with probability
    $$\frac{2 \cdot 1}{3^2} + \frac{1 \cdot 2}{3^2} = \frac{4}{9} \implies \boxed{13}$$
