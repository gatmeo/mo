    Let $p_n(k)$ be the number of permutations of the set $S=\{1,2,3,\ldots,n\}$ which have exactly $k$ fixed points. Prove that
    \[
        \sum_{k=0}^nk p_n(k)=n!.
    \]
    (A permutation $p$ is a bijective map from $S\rightarrow S$. An element $s\in S$ is called a fixed point of $p$ if $p(s)=s$.)

    Let $X$ be the collection of all pairs $(s, p)$ where $p\in \textnormal{Sym}_n$ is a permutation with $s\in S$ being one of its fixed points. We will count $X$ in two ways:

    LHS: For any $p\in \textnormal{Sym}_n$ with exactly $k$ fixed points, it admits $k$ such pairs in $X$. Hence $|X|=\sum_{k=0}^nk p_n(k)$.

        RHS: For any $s\in S$, there are obviously $(n-1)!$ permutations fix $s$. Hence $|X|=n\cdot (n-1)!$.
