    A group of 10 people went to a bookstore. It is known that
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Everyone bought exactly 3 books;
        \item For every two persons, there is at least one book that both of them bought.
    \end{enumerate}
    What is the least number of people that could have bought the book purchased by the greatest number
    of people?
    }{%
    Let $b_1, b_2,\dots,b_p$ the distinct books, purchased in $n_1, n_2,\dots$ respectively $n_p$ copies.
    $N=n_1+n_2+\dots+n_p=30$.
    If a person $P$ buys the books $b_i, b_j,b_k, 1\le i,j,k\le p$, denote $B_P=\{b_i, b_j, b_k\}$.
    For each another person $Q$ is true the statement:
    $b_i\in B_Q$ or $b_j\in B_Q$ or $b_k\in B_Q$.
    Results: $(n_i-1)+(n_j-1)+(n_k-1)\ge 9 \quad (1)\Longrightarrow$
    $\Longrightarrow \max{(n_i, n_j,n_k)}\ge4 \Longrightarrow \max\limits_{1\le q\le p}n_q\ge4$.

    If $\max\limits_{1\le q\le p}n_q=4$, for any $B_P=\{b_i, b_j, b_k\}$ results $(n_i-1)+(n_j-1)+(n_k-1)\le 9$.
    From $(1)$, we have $(n_i-1)+(n_j-1)+(n_k-1)\ge 9$.
    Results $n_q=4, \forall 1\le q\le p$, hence the total number of purchased books is $N=4p$.
    But $N=30$ and $4\nmid30$, contradiction.
    Results $\max\limits_{1\le q\le p}n_q$ can not be $4$.

    For $\max\limits_{1\le q\le p}n_q=5$ exists at least a solution, for example:
    $(b_1,b_2,b_3);\quad (b_1,b_3,b_4);\quad (b_1,b_4,b_5);\quad (b_1,b_5,b_6);\quad (b_1,b_5,b_6)$;
    $(b_2,b_3,b_5);\quad (b_2,b_3,b_5);\quad (b_2,b_4,b_6);\quad (b_2,b_4,b_6);\quad (b_3,b_4,b_6)$.
    Conclusion: the least possible $\max\limits_{1\le q\le p}n_q$ is $5$.
