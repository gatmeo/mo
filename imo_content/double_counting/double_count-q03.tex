\pitem[LMNas UGM 32 Final Round]{%
    Determine the smallest natural number $n$ such that there exist sets $A_1, A_2, \ldots, A_n \subseteq \{1, 2, 3, \cdots, n\}$ satisfying the following criteria:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item $i \not \in A_i$ for every $i = 1, 2, \ldots, n$;
        \item $i \in A_j$ if and only if $j \not \in A_i$ for every distinct $i$ and $j$ where $i, j \in \{1, 2, \ldots, n\}$;
        \item $A_i \cap A_j$ is not an empty set for every $i, j \in \{1, 2, \ldots, n\}$.
    \end{enumerate}
    }{%
    The answer is $\boxed{n=7}$.
    First of all, let's count $\sum_{i=1}^n|A_i|$. Let's transfer each number $(1-n)$ and each set $(A_1-A_n$) to a bipirtite graph. Conect to points if $1$ of them is number,another is set and this number is in this set. Not let's see this quadruplet $\{i,j,A_i,A_j\}$. From the statement,we get this subgraph has $1$ edge and since we can choose $\{i,j\}$ in $\frac{n(n-1)}{2}$ ways there are $\frac{n(n-1)}{2}$ edges in this graph. So, $\sum_{i=1}^n|A_i|=\frac{n(n-1)}{2}$.
    Obviously $n=1,2$ doesn't work. Assume $n\geq3 $. Now asssume that there is a set with less than $3$ elements.
    
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item 
            If there is a set with exactly $1$ element: $\text{WLOG}$ it be $A_1=\{2\}$. Since $A_1\cap A_2\ne \varnothing$ we get $2\in A_2$ which is contradiction.
        \item 
            If there is a set with exactly $2$ element: $\text{WLOG}$ it be $A_1=\{2,3\}$. Since $A_1\cap A_2,A_3\ne \varnothing$ we get $3\in A_2$ and $2\in A_3$ , which is not allowed. Contradiction.
    \end{enumerate}

    So we get $|A_i|\geq3$ $\implies$ $\sum_{i=1}^n|A_i|=\frac{n(n-1)}{2}\geq 3n$ $\implies$ $n\geq 7$. Constraction for $n=7$ can be like this :
    $A_1=\{2,3,4\}$
    $A_2=\{3,5,7\}$
    $A_3=\{4,6,7\}$
    $A_4=\{2,5,6\}$
    $A_5=\{1,3,6\}$
    $A_6=\{1,2,7\}$
    $A_7=\{1,4,5\}$
