\pitem[IMO 1998 Q2]{%
    In a contest, there are $m$ candidates and $n$ judges, where $n\geq 3$ is an odd integer. Each candidate is evaluated by each judge as either pass or fail. Suppose that each pair of judges agrees on at most $k$ candidates. Prove that \[{\frac{k}{m}} \geq {\frac{n-1}{2n}}. \]
    }{%
    We double count triplets $(J_p, J_q, C)$, where $J_p$ and $J_q$ are judges, and candidate $C$ is agreed upon by the two judges. Let $T$ be the number of such triplets.

    We first count by pairs of judges. Pick two judges, $A$ and $B$. Then, there are at most $k$ candidates $A$ and $B$ agree upon. Since there are $\binom{n}{2}$ choices for $(A, B)$, $T \leq k\binom{n}{2}$.

    Next, we count by candidates. Let $a(x)$ be the number of judges who PASS candidate $x$. We find that $T = \sum \left(\binom{a(x)}{2} + \binom{n - a(x)}{2}\right)$, where the sum ranges across all candidates.

    The rest of the solution is just boring algebra. We include it here for completeness.

    By convexity, we have (recall that $n$ is odd)
    \[
         \binom{a(x)}{2} + \binom{n - a(x)}{2}  \geq  \binom{\left(\frac{n + 1}{2}\right)}{2} + \binom{\left(\frac{n - 1}{2}\right)}{2} =  \frac{(n - 1)^2}{4} \mbox{.} 
    \]
    Since there are $m$ candidates, we find that
    \begin{eqnarray*} T & \geq & \frac{m(n - 1)^2}{4} \mbox{.} \end{eqnarray*}
    Thus,
    \begin{eqnarray*}
    k\binom{n}{2} & \geq & \frac{m(n - 1)^2}{4} \\
\frac{1}{2}kn(n - 1) & \geq & \frac{m(n - 1)^2}{4} \\
\frac{k}{m} & \geq & \frac{n - 1}{2n}.
k\end{eqnarray*}
