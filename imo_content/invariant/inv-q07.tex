    Numbers $\frac{49}{1}, \frac{49}{2}, ... , \frac{49}{97}$ are writen on a blackboard. Each time, we can replace two numbers (like $a, b$) with $2ab-a-b+1$. After $96$ times doing that prenominate action, one number will be left on the board. Find all the possible values fot that number.
    }{%
    We observe that $2(2ab-a-b+1)-1=(2a-1)(2b-1)$. Then
    there is an invariant $\Pi = \Pi_n = \prod_{i=1}^n (2a_i -1)$, where $n$ is the number of the numbers written on the blackboard. Since $\Pi_{97} = 1$, it follows the last number will also be $\Pi_1 = 1$.
