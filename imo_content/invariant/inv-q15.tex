    A circle is divided into six sectors. Then the numbers $ 1,0,1,0,0,0$ are written into the sectors. You may increase two neighboring numbers by $ 1$. Is it possible to equalize all numbers by a sequence of such steps?
    }{%
    Let the numbers in the sectors be $ a,b,c,d,e,f$. Initially, $(a,b,c,d,e,f)=(1,0,1,0,0,0)$. Consider the sum $ S=a-b+c-d+e-f$. If two neighboring numbers increase by $ 1$, $ S$ remains constant, hence $S$ is invariant. Notice that if all numbers are equal, then $S=0$.  Yet, initially $S=2$. Hence it is not possible.
