\pitem[MEMO 2018 I2]{%
    The two figures depicted below consisting of $6$ and $10$ unit squares, respectively, are called staircases.
    Consider a $2018\times 2018$ board consisting of $2018^2$ cells, each being a unit square. Two arbitrary
    cells were removed from the same row of the board. Prove that the rest of the board cannot be cut (along the cell borders) into staircases (possibly rotated).
    }{%
    Impossibility proofs in tiling theory = coloring. (Unless we can do something about the special shape of the staircases.) Chessboard coloring: the two removed cells could be black or white. We need a more row-specific coloring!

    Coloring odd rows black and even rows white, the staircases cover $4/2$, $6/4$ resp. Not helpful: the difference caused by the two cut out cells is also $=2$. Another row coloring? How about first two white, next two black, next two white, etc.? Staircases could cover $3/3$, $1/5$, $7/3$, $5/5$. Of course, this means
    $$4|\text{covered white}-\text{covered black}.$$But in the mutilated board, the difference is $=\pm 2$. So the mutilated board cannot be covered, done.
