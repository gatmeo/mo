    Wanda the Worm likes to eat Pascal's triangle. One day, she starts at the top of the triangle and eats $\textstyle\binom{0}{0}=1$. Each move, she travels to an adjacent positive integer and eats it, but she can never return to a spot that she has previously eaten. If Wanda can never eat numbers $a,b,c$ such that $a+b=c$, prove that it is possible for her to eat 100,000 numbers in the first 2011 rows given that she is not restricted to traveling only in the first 2011 rows.

    (Here, the $n+1$st row of Pascal's triangle consists of entries of the form $\textstyle\binom{n}{k}$ for integers $0\le k\le n$. Thus, the entry $\textstyle\binom{n}{k}$ is considered adjacent to the entries $\textstyle\binom{n-1}{k-1}$, $\textstyle\binom{n-1}{k}$, $\textstyle\binom{n}{k-1}$, $\textstyle\binom{n}{k+1}$, $\textstyle\binom{n+1}{k}$, $\textstyle\binom{n+1}{k+1}$.)

    Lemma: Wanda can eat all the odd entries from rows $0$ to $2^n-1$ and ending at $\binom{2^n-1}{0}$ or $\binom{2^n-1}{2^n-1}$.

    Proof of Lemma: The key idea is that Pascal's triangle mod 2 up to row $2^{n+1}-1$ (call it $T_{n+1}$) can be viewed as three copies of the triangle till row $2^n-1$, or $T_n$, in the following fashion:
    \begin{figure}[H]

%            unitsize(1.5cm); draw((0,0)--(2,0)--2*dir(60)--cycle); draw((1,0)--dir(60)--sqrt(3)*dir(30)--cycle); label("$T_n$",1/sqrt(3)*dir(30)); label("$T_n$",(1,0)+1/sqrt(3)*dir(30)); label("$T_n$",dir(60)+1/sqrt(3)*dir(30)); label("$0$",2/sqrt(3)*dir(30)); dot("$A$",2*dir(60),dir(90)); dot("$B$",dir(60),dir(150)); dot("$C$",sqrt(3)*dir(30),dir(30)); dot("$D$",0,dir(210)); dot("$E$",dir(0),dir(270)); dot("$F$",2*dir(0),dir(-30));
%        \end{asy}

    \end{figure}
    THe statement is obvious for $T_1$. Suppose the problem is true for $T_n$. Use the inductive hypothesis to get all the odds in $ABC$, and end at $B$. Now use the inductive hypothesis on $BDE$ to get to $E$. Use the inductive hypothesis on $ECF$ to get to $F$, and this finishes (note that $T_n$ is symmetric under rotation by $2\pi/3$). This completes the proof. $\blacksquare$

    Now, note that there are no odd $a,b,c$ with $a+b=c$. Note that $T_n$ has $3^n$ odd entries (proof is by induction). We see that using our strategy in the lemma, Wanda can eat all the odd entries till row $2047$. Above row $2011$ are at least a $T_{10}$, two $T_9$s, and two $T_8$s, for a total of at least
    \[3^{10}+2\cdot 3^9+2\cdot 3^8=111537\ge 100,000\]odd numbers, as desired.
