    Let $S_n $ be sum of squares of the coefficient of the polynomial $(1+x)^n$. Prove that $S_{2n} +1$ is not divisible by $3.$
    }{%
    $S_n=\sum_{k=0}^n \binom{n}{k}^2=\binom{2n}{n}$ (by double counting). Then $S_{2n}+1=\binom{4n}{2n}+1$.

    $\textbf{Lemma :}$
    If $\binom{2x}{x}$ is not divisible by $p$. and $x=(a_0,\dots,a_t)_p$ then $0 \leq a_i \leq \frac{p-1}{2} $ and
    $2x=(2a_0 ,\dots , 2a_t)_p$

    Proof: obvious by either Lucas or Kummer.

    So by the lemma $2n=(a_0,\dots ,a_t)_3$ s.t $a_i \in \{0,1\} $
    So FSoC
    $-1 = \binom{4n}{2n} = \sum_{i=0}^{t} \binom{2a_i}{a_i} $ $\text{mod} (3)$
    Notice each term of RHS becomes $-1$ if $a_i = 1$ and otherwise $1$.
    so we should have odd number of them equal to $1$.
    But $2n = a_0 + a_1 3+ \dots + a_t 3^t$ ($\spadesuit$)
    odd number of $a_i$'s are $1$ so RHS of ($\spadesuit$) is odd but LHS of it is even.
    Contradiction $\blacksquare$
