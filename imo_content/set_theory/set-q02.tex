    Let $S$ be a subset of $\left \{1,2,...,2019 \right \}$ with the following property: for any three numbers $a,b,c \in S$ we have $2020 \nmid a+b+c $ and $2020 \nmid a+b-c $. Determine the largest possible number of elements that $S$ can have.
    }{%

    We are going to prove that$|S|<=1010$

    Let $c$ be the smallest element of the $S$ then consider the sets:
    $(c+1,2019),(c+2,2018),.....,(c+k,2020-k)$
    Such that $k$ is the max number from which$c+k<=2020-k$

    Now we can see that if we have two elements for one of these $k$ subject then we can take this elements and the $c$ and we have:$a+b=2020+c$ which means $2020|a+b-c=2020$
    So from each subject we can take at most $1$ element

    Therefore $max|S|=k+1$ but also we know that $c+2k<=2020$ so $k<=1009$ which gives $max|S|<=1010$


    The number $1010$ can be achieved we the set $S=(1,3,5,.....,2019)$
