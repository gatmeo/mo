    Suppose that $\mathcal F\subseteq {[n]\choose k}$. We know that for every three distinct elements of $\mathcal F$ like $A,B,C$, at most one of $A\cap B$,$B\cap C$ and $C\cap A$ is $\phi$. for $k\le \frac{n}{2}$ prove that:
    \[|\mathcal F|\le max(1,4-\frac{n}{k})\times \dbinom{n-1}{k-1}.\]

    We can split the question into the following cases:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item 
            All the intersections are nonempty - then by Erdos-Ko-Rado $|F| \le \dbinom{n-1}{k-1}.$
        \item 
            $\exists i,j$ s.t $A_i \cap A_j=\emptyset.$ Notice that, then $\forall t \neq i,j$ we have $A_t \cap A_i \neq \emptyset$ and $A_t \cap A_j \neq \emptyset.$

            Now, consider random permutation $\pi$ of set $X$ and arrange $\pi(1),...,\pi(n)$ on circle by clockwise order. Consider some random set $P$ generated by random $i$ s.t $P=\{\pi(i),...,\pi(k+i-1) \}.$

            Let's count now the number of elements of $F$ on circle such that they contain $k$ consecutive numbers (label it by $u$ and call such sets good).
            \begin{enumerate}
                \item If on the circle there are no good sets with empty intersection, we have $u \le k.$ So if we let $\mathbb P$ be the probability that $P \in F,$ then $$\mathbb P=\frac{|F|}{\dbinom{n}{k}} \le \frac{k}{n}$$so it follows that $|F| \le \dbinom{n-1}{k-1}. (*)$
                \item If there are good sets with empty intersections, let them be $A_i, A_j.$ By previous, any $A_t$ must have non-empty intersection with both of them. Let the one distance between endpoints of $A_i, A_j$ be $a$ and let the other one be $b.$ Clearly, $a+b=n-2k$ i.e $(k-a)+(k-b)=4k-n.$

                    On the other hand, we must have $u \le (k-a-1)+(k-b-1)+2 = 2k-(a+b)=4k-n.$ Hence, as in 2.1 we have $$\mathbb P=\frac{|F|}{\dbinom{n}{k}} \le \frac{4k-n}{n}=\frac{k}{n}\cdot (4-\frac{n}{k}) \implies |F| \le (4-\frac{n}{k}) \cdot \dbinom{n-1}{k-1} (**)$$
            \end{enumerate}
    \end{enumerate}
    So, from $(*),(**)$ result follows.
