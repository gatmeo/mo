    Let $ S$ be a set with $ n$ elements, and $ F$ be a family of subsets of $ S$ with $ 2^{n-1}$ elements, such that for each $ A,B,C\in F$, $ A\cap B\cap C$ is not empty. Prove that the intersection of all of the elements of $ F$ is not empty.

    Let $\mathcal{F}_n$ be the family of all subsets of $[n]$. Let $\mathcal{F}_n(k)$ be the subfamily of elements of $\mathcal{F}$ that contain $k\in[n]$. Let the family in the problem be $\mathcal{G}$. Observe the natural poset isomorphism $\mathcal{F}_n(k)\cong \mathcal{F}_{n-1}$. Let $P_n$ be the partition of $\mathcal{F}_n$ into pairs of complements. Suppose that the claim is false; that for every $k\in[n]$, there is a $S\in\mathcal{G}$ so that $k\not\in S$. Clearly $\mathcal{G}$ has at most one element from each pair in $P_n$, and since there are $2^{n-1}$ pairs in $P_n$, $\mathcal{G}$ must have exactly one element from each pair. Consider the partition of $\mathcal{F}_n(k)$ induced by the natural poset isomorphism above and $P_{n-1}$ (call it $P_n(k)\cong P_{n-1}$). Note that each pair in $P_n(k)$ intersects to form the singleton $\{k\}$. But no two elements of $\mathcal{G}$ can intersect in a singleton; otherwise we can find by hypothesis some element of $\mathcal{G}$ not containing said singleton, and the intersection of these three sets is empty, a contradiction. So there are at most $2^{n-2}$ elements of $\mathcal{G}$ in any $\mathcal{F}_n(k)$. It follows that $\mathbb P_{S\in\mathcal{G}}(k\in S)\leqslant 0.5$, and by Linearilty of expectation we see that $\mathbb E_{S\in\mathcal{G}}(|S|)\leqslant 0.5 n$. Now partition $\mathcal{F}_n$ into families $K_0,K_1,\dots,K_n$ where $S\in K_i\iff |S|=i$. Note that if $S\in K_i$ then the element of $\mathcal{F}_n$ paired $S$ to by $P_n$ is in $K_{n-i}$. Finally, $\mathcal{G}\cap K_i$ must respect the Erd≈ës-Ko-Rado Theorem when $i\leqslant 0.5n$, since there are no two sets in $\mathcal{G}$ with empty intersection. But $i<0.5n\implies \tfrac{\tbinom{n-1}{k-1}}{\tbinom{n}{k}}=\tfrac{k}{n}<0.5$, so $\mathbb E_{S\in\mathbb{G}}(|S|)>0.5n$, a contradiction
