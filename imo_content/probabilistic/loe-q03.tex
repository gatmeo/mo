\pitem[IMC 2017 q4]{%
    There are $n$ people in a city, and each of them has exactly $1000$ friends (friendship is always symmetric). Prove that it is possible to select a group $S$ of people such that at least $\frac{n}{2017}$ persons in $S$ have exactly two friends in $S$.
    }{%
    Let $d=1000$ and let $0<p<1$. Choose the set $S$ randomly such that each people is selected with probability $p$, independently from the others.

    The probability that a certain person is selected for $S$ and knows exactly two members of $S$ is $q={d\choose 2}p^3(1-p)^{d-2}$. Choose $p=3/(d+1)$ (this is the value of $p$ for which $q$ is maximal); then
    \begin{alignat*}{1}
        q&= {d\choose 2}\left(\frac{3}{d+1}\right)^3\left(\frac{d-2}{d+1}\right)^{d-2}\\
         &= \frac{27d(d-1)}{2(d+1)^3}\left(1+\frac{3}{d-2}\right)^{-(d-2)}\\
         &>\frac{27d(d-1)}{2(d+1)^3}\cdot e^{-3}\\
         &> \frac{1}{2017}.
    \end{alignat*}
    Hence $E(\left|S\right|)=nq>\frac{n}{2017}$, so there is a choice for $S$ when $\left|S\right|>\frac{n}{2017}$.
