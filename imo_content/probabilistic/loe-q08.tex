\pitem[]{%
    Show that one can construct a round-robin tournament outcome with more than 1000 people such that for any set of 1000 people, some contestant outside the set beats all of them.
    }{%
    Choose tournament outcome randomly. The result then follows from the expected number of 1000-subset failures $$ < (1-2^{1000})^n n^{1000} < 1$$when $n$ is large.
