\pitem[]{%
    16 students took part in a mathematical competition where every problem was a multiple choice question with four choices. After the contest, it is found that any two students had at most one answer in common. Prove that there are at most 5 problems in the contest.
    }{%
    At most $\binom{16}{2} = 120$ shared answers, but at least $\binom{4}{2} + \binom{4}{2} + \binom{4}{2} + \binom{4}{2} = 24$ shared answers per problem, so at most $\frac{120}{24} = 5$ problems.
