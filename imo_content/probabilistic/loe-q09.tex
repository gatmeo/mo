    In the Duma there are 1600 delegates, who have formed 16000 committees of 80 persons each. Prove that one can find two committees having no fewer than four common members.
    }{%
    Consider a random couple of committees, and let $X$ be the number of delegates that join both of them. Consider $a_{d}$ the number of committees that include delegate ${d}$. As the average person is on $16000\cdot 80/1600=800$, by Jensen's inequality the expected value of $X$ is
    \[\mathbb E [X]=\sum_{d} \frac{\binom{a_{d}}{2}}{\binom{16000}{2}}\geq \frac{1600\binom{\frac{\sum a_{d}}{1600}}{2}}{\binom{16000}{2}}= \frac{1600\binom{\frac{16000 \cdot 80}{1600}}{2}}{\binom{16000}{2}} = \frac{1600\binom{800}{2}}{\binom{16000}{2}}>3,\]
    and the conclusion follows.
