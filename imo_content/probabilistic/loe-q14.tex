\pitem[Caro-Wei Theorem]{%
    Consider a graph $G$ with vertex set $V$ . Prove that one can find an independent set of $V$ (pairwise non-adjacent) with size at least
    \[\sum_{v\in V}^{}\frac{1}{\deg v + 1}.\]
    \begin{remark}
        By applying Jensen's inequality, our independent set has size at least $\frac{n}{d+1}$, where $d$ is the average degree. This result is called Turan's Theorem.
    \end{remark}
    }{%
    Randomly order the vertices $\left\{v_1,\dots ,v_n\right\}$ of $G$, and take $W$ to be the subset of those $v_i$ which occur before all their neighbors. Then
    \[\EE[|W|]=\sum_{i}^{}ind(v_i\in W)=\sum_{i}^{}\frac{1}{deg(v)+1}.\]
