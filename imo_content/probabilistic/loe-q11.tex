    Suppose $799$ teams participate in a round-robin tournament. Prove that one can find two disjoint groups $A$ and $B$ of seven teams each such that all teams in $A$ defeated all teams in $B$.
    }{%
    We are going to prove we can partition the group of 14 into two groups of 7.

    Let $D_k$ be the set of teams which defeat the $k$-th team (here $1\leq k\leq 799$), and $d_k=|D_k|$. Select $A=\left\{a_1,\dots ,a_7\right\}$ randomly, so $\mathbb{P}(A\subseteq D_k)={d_k\choose 7}/{799\choose 7}$. Let $N$ be the number of teams domintated by $A$, we have $\EE[N]=\sum_{k}^{}{d_k\choose 7}/{799\choose 7}$. Since ${x\choose 7}$ is convex, and the average value of $d_k$ is $798/2=398$, by Jensen's we have
    \[\EE[N]\geq 799\cdot {398\choose 7}/{799\choose 7}>799\cdot \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^7>6.\]
    Hence sometimes $N\geq 7$.
