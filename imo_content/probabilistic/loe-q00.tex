\pitem[NIMO 4.3]{%
    One day, a bishop and a knight were on squares in the same row of an infinite chessboard, when a huge meteor storm occurred, placing a meteor in each square on the chessboard independently and randomly with probability p. Neither the bishop nor the knight were hit, but their movement may have been obstructed by the meteors. For what value of p is the expected number of valid squares that the bishop can move to (in one move) equal to the expected number of squares that the knight can move to (in one move)?
    }{%
    $8(1-p) = 4 ((1 -p) + (1 -p)2 + (1 -p)3 + \cdots ).$
