    Let us choose $n$ elements from the set $\left\{1,2,\dots ,x,x+1,\dots ,x+y\right\}$. Some of these $n$ elements have to be among $1,2,\dots ,x$. Let the number of those be $k$. The remaining $n-k$ elements have to be among $x+1,\dots ,x+y$. There exists $\binom{x}{k}\binom{y}{n-k}$ such configurations and $k$ could be between $0$ and $n$. This is the so-called Vandermonde identity.
