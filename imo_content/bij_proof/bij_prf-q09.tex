    The Fibonacci numbers $F_n$ are defined by $F_1=F_2=1$ and $F_{n+1}=F_n+F_{n_1}$ for $n\geq 2$. Prove that
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item the number $f(n)$ of compositions of $n$ with parts $1$ and $2$ is $F_{n+1}$,
        \item the numberof compositions of $n$ with all parts $>1$ is $F_{n-1}$, and
        \item the number of compositions of $n$ with odd parts is $F_n$.
    \end{enumerate}
    }{%
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Clearly, $F(1)=1=F_2$ and $f(2)=2=F_3$. Consider the $f(n)$ compositions of $n\geq 3$ with parts $1$ and $2$. The number of them having last part $1$ is $f(n-1)$ and those having last part $2$ is $f(n-2)$ since after removing this last part, we obtain another compositions with parts $1$ and $2$ for $n-1$ and $n-2$ respectively. Also, having any of the $f(n-2)$ (or the $f(n-1)$) compositions to 1s and 2s of $n-2$ (or $n-1$), we get such composition for $n$ by adding $2$ (or $1$) at the end.
        \item Denote the number of compositions of $n$ with all parts $>1$ with $g(n)$. Trivially, $g(2)=g(3)=1$. Consider all the $g(n)$ compositions for some $n>3$. If the last part is $2$ for some of them and we remove this part, we get a composition of $n-2$ having all parts $> 1$. Now, consider the case when the last part is $\geq 3$. If we remove $1$ from this last part, we obtain partition with all parts $> 1$ of $n-1$. On the other hand, we can add one part of size $2$ to the end of each composition among those $g(n-2)$ or 1 to the last part of each such composition of $n-1$ to obtain one of the compositions in $g(n)$. Since the only options are to have last part $2$ or last part $\geq 3$ and these two subsets of compositions does not intersect, we can conclude that $g(n)=g(n-1)+g(n-2)$.
        \item Denote the number of described compositions of $n$ with $h(n)$. We have $h(1) = 1 = F(1)$ and $h(2) = 1 = F(2)$. Use similar observations to those for the previous problem.  Given a composition with odd parts, we could have either last part 1 or otherwise we can remove $2$ from this last part.
