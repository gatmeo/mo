    Find the number of subsets of $S$ of $[n]$ that do not contain two consecutive integers.
    }{%
    Let the number of those subsets be denoted with $g(n)$. Check that $g(1)=2^1$ and $g(2)=2^2-1=3$. Consider those $S\subseteq [n]$ containing $n$ and those not containing $n$. For the former case, we know that $n-1\notin S$ and $S\setminus n$ does not contain two consecutive integers. The set $S\setminus n$ could be any such subset of $[n-2]$. Thus we get $g(n-2)$ subsets of $[n]$ containing $n$ and withouth two consecutive integers in them. For the case $n\notin S$, we know that $S\subseteq [n-1]$ without having two consecutive integers in it and that each such $S$ is a subsets of $[n]$. Therefore, we obtain $g(n)=g(n-1)+g(n-2)$ for $n\geq 3$ and given the initial conditions we get that $g(n)=F_{n+2}$.
