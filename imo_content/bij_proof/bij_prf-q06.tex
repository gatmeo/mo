    Consider a choice of $n$ elements out of $x+n+1$ elements. Among the last $n+1$ there must be at least one unchosen element. Denote the unchosen element with the biggest number with $x+k+1$. We know that the $n-k=(x+n+1)-(x+k+1)$ elements having bigger numbers are selected, thus in order to determine the choice of the $n$ elements completely, we have to select the rest $n-(n-k)=k$ elements from the remaining $x+k$ elements. This reasoning shows that the given equality is a partition of all possible choices of $n$ elements out of $x+n+1$ elements by the number of the largest unchosen element.
