    Let $S = \{1,2,3,\ldots,n\}$. Consider a function $f\colon S\to S$. A subset $D$ of $S$ is said to be invariant if for all $x\in D$ we have $f(x)\in D$. The empty set and $S$ are also considered as invariant subsets. By $\deg (f)$ we define the number of invariant subsets $D$ of $S$ for the function $f$.

    i) Show that there exists a function $f\colon S\to S$ such that $\deg (f)=2$.

    ii) Show that for every $1\leq k\leq n$ there exists a function $f\colon S\to S$ such that $\deg (f)=2^{k}$.

    lets take f to be a permutation. consider a permutation where

(n-t+2,...,n) are fixed points. and consider the biggest of the remaining elements; assign the biggest i.e (n-t+1) to f(1) ; and the smallest to f(2), second smallest to f(3)(if it is possible ) and so on

this works (easy to prove)


for example the required permutation of (1,2,..,5) with degree 2^3 is (3,1,2,4,5)
