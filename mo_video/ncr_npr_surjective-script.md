# Set Theoretic Concept Behind nPr and nCr

For those who have seen the formulas for nPr and nCr, 
Or we are trying to find a fancy way to count things.
What do we need to check? Or what are the fundamental concepts behind these?

When we talk about the operations of combinatorics, the common ones are +,-,*.
Examples

But the interesting one is division, our main target.


But why can we do divison here? In particular, why do we have nCr = nPr/r!?
